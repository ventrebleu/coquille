We researched the differences between default browser styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need normalizing.\n\n[Check out the demo](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/demo.html)\n\nWhat does it do?\n-----------\n\n* Preserves useful defaults, unlike many CSS resets.\n* Normalizes styles for a wide range of elements.\n* Corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies.\n* Improves usability with subtle improvements.\n* Explains what code does using detailed comments.\n\nHow to use it\n-----------\n\nNormalize.css is intended to be used as an alternative to CSS resets.\n\nIt is suggested that you read through the `normalize.css` file and customise it to meet the design requirements of a project rather including it as a \"black box\".\n\nIf you prefer to use a different CSS formatting style, consider using a tool like [Procssor](http://procssor.com/).\n\nIf you would like to minify the file, you can use a tool like this [online CSS compressor using YUI Compressor](http://www.refresh-sf.com/yui/) or perform the minification as part of your build process.\n\nBrowser support\n-----------\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Mozilla Firefox 3+\n* Apple Safari 4+\n* Opera 10+\n* Internet Explorer 6+\n\nContribute\n-----------\n\nPlease read the Wiki entry on [contributing to Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/wiki/contribute)\n\nLicense\n-----------\n\nPublic domain\n\nAcknowledgements\n------------\n\nNormalize.css is a project by [Nicolas Gallagher](http://github.com/necolas) and [Jonathan Neal](http://github.com/jonathantneal).\n",
